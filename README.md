=========================

Seriously cross-platform with HTML5

#The jQuery Mobile Workshop#
So what is this? It's a jQuery mobile workshop that I'm giving (first run at [Rich Web Experience](https://therichwebexperience.com/conference/fort_lauderdale/2013/12/home)) The goal is simple: get people up to speed on jQuery mobile. Here's the conference blurb:

##Conference Blurb##
The word just came down from the VP - you need a mobile app and you need it yesterday. It needs to be polished and have that design stuff too. Oh and it needs to be on all the major platforms in time for the big marketing push next month. After a moment of panic, you wonder if it's too late to become a plumber but don't worry, there's hope! More and more developers are falling in love with the "write less do more" library and for good reason; it simplifies the job of today's front end engineer. But did you know jQuery could also help you with your mobile needs as well? That's right, jQuery Mobile is a touch optimized framework designed to provide a common look and feel across a wide variety of today's mot popular platforms. In this workshop, we'll take a look at all that jQuery Mobile has to offer and we'll convert a native application to an HTML5, jQuery Mobile masterpiece.

In this workshop, we'll build a mobile app taking advantage of everything jQuery Mobile and HTML5 have to offer. In this session, we'll take a look at:
* pages
* toolbars
* buttons
* form elements
* list views
In the process of building out an app or two, we'll show you how jQuery Mobile simplifies the process of mobile app development.

##Prerequisites##
Attendees are expected to have a laptop (or be very good at quickly making friends with someone that has one). On said laptop, you should have at least one (ideally multiple) modern browsers:
